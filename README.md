🔒 Data & Confidentiality

All data structures, screenshots, and examples have been anonymised to protect commercial and customer confidentiality.
This repository focuses on process, architecture, and analytical approach rather than sensitive data.

2. Add alerting for pipeline or data anomalies
3. Extend reporting to include forecasting
4. Integrate additional data sources (e.g. marketing or finance)
